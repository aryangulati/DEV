# Contribution Guide

This Guide defines how, what, and where to contribute for a meaningful use of your time and efforts while actively learning.
### What to contribute?
* Follow a repository's contribution guidelines and make meaningful contributuons.
* Don't make PRs for petty changes like text edits.
* Your PR should not be a deliberate attempt of completing 4 PRs.

The purpose of this event and repo is to help learn how to contribute. So, one PR from everyone is expected.
There are 3 folders namely

- Dev_Jokes_and_Quotes
- Hello_World
- Projects

You can contribute to any of the latter two, while adding any developer joke to Dev_Jokes_and_Quotes (optional). 
Keep all your commits in one (1) PR, rather than making new PR for every change and spamming.

### How to contribute?
The most important part of contribution is working on a version of the code/repo without disturbing the overall flow, while others can do the same. For the purpose we follow the given flow. These instructions only cover the basics and changes via github. If you wish to edit and make changes on your system directly instead of github, read here.
1. Visit the repo [here](https://github.com/aryangulati/Hacktoberfest2020). Fork the repository from the Fork button in the top-right corner.

2. Now you must have a version of the main repo with all the commits previously commited to it and PRs merged having own URL as `https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Hacktoberfest2020`.
3. Make a branch (preferably by your name in our case) to make your changes. For github, this can be done as below:
![Branch Github](/src/branch-github.png)
4. Make a new file or upload one you made locally on your computer.
![Create/Upload](/src/contribute.png)
5. Or you can edit an existing file via github. But make sure that your edit is actually useful and relevant. It should not be a deliberate attempt of making PR.
![Edit Existing](/src/edit-existing.png)
6. In both cases (step 4 & 5), the natural next step is to commit the changes you have made. Use a readable and description title and (optional) description.
![Commit](/src/Commit.png)
7. Creating Pull Request. The name itself says it all, you are **request**ing the original repo's maintainer/owner to **pull** the changes you have made into theirs.
![Create PR](/src/createPR.png)
8. Fill the necessary details and create PR.
![Create PR2](/src/createPR2.png)

And VOILA!!! You have made your contribution.
Now just wait for the maintainer to review your PR, discuss with the community and make any changes as needed/suggested/requested by maintainer/owner.

### How-to contribute from your system?
This becomes necessary when you are contributing to medium/large projects and/or to generally codebase that uses servers (Nodejs, PHP unlike the usual txt,md,py etc formats) because their code can't be copy pasted into an online compiler and executed.

1. Make a fork of the repo you’ve chosen for your contributions.
2. [From the fork, click Clone or download to create a copy on your computer.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
3. [Create a pull request from the branch on your fork into the master branch of the base repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
