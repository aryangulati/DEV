#include<stdio.h>//Here, we have included stdio.h library which provides many standard functions in C

int main(){
  printf("Hello Hacktoberfest");//Semi-colon is very important in C
  return 0;//since the main function has return type integer so the value returned is 0 coz it is a integer
  }
  //HAPPY CODING
